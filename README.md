# K-means
k-means is  one of  the simplest unsupervised  learning  algorithms  that  solve  the well  known clustering problem. The procedure follows a simple and  easy  way  to classify a given data set  through a certain number of  clusters.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I have  created  this project to show K-means clustering is one of the most widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithms that forms clusters of data based on the similarity between data instances using Python.

Reasons to work on this Project:

Working on a project which focuses on a real life probelms will be helpful for people and other patrons who tend to use it in their projects or personal analysis . A project that solves a problem and helps others is always a advanatge .

With the help of this repository, it will be easier to generate your own python and make necessary changes as per your requirement.

You may also suggest changes or further in depth analysis by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people who will be contributing to expand this project!

### Built With

This section  lists any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap the project. 

* [ANACONDA](https://www.anaconda.com/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This section explains how we may give instructions on setting up our project locally.


### Prerequisites

This is the list of OS and softwares we need
* Windows 10
* Jupiter Notebook
* Phython

### Installation

1. Download and install ANACONDA
2. Jupitor notebook comes with ANACONDA package. So, We don't need to worry about it
3. By default Jupitor notebook access C drive. If we wish to customize,We need to Open command prompt and paste the following command
   jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=directory_path
4. We need to make sure that our Pc has sufficient RAM to perform the analysis.
